             Since the areas of application of information-measuring systems are quite large, mathematical models of objects
             are as diverse as possible. However, the methods of mathematical modeling allow the same formulas to represent
             objects different in nature and used to study and solve problems of optimization and synthesis of information
             systems.

        <h2>Mathematical model of Melnikova and Mathematical model of Dmitrieva</h2>

        <div align="justify">
            In her scientific work, Melnikova explores the issues of controlling the speed of tape conveyors depending on
            the load on the belt, which was repeatedly considered by a number of scientists. Also she takes into account
            the angle of the conveyor.
            In order to implement the proposed method of automatic control of the conveyor line, a loaded conveyor should
            be stopped with subsequent start-up, which may lead to a rupture of the belt. Therefore, the second task of
            Melnikova's research is to establish the regularities of a trouble-free launch of a loaded conveyor.
            The results of her research are presented in the figures below. As can be seen from the graphs, only when
            adjusting the speed of horizontal belt conveyors does the power consumed by the electric drive decrease, which
            means that the electric power consumption also decreases.
        </div>

        <div align="justify">
            The mathematical model of Dmitrieva is based on the principle of dividing the contour of a tape into a number
            of sections. The construction of the mathematical model is based on the second-order Lagrange method.
            As a result, we obtained a system of equations and transient processes with respect to the velocities of the
            common coordinates. The graphs correspond to the acceleration mode and the operating mode of the conveyor with
            a constant speed.

        <h2>Mathematical model of Razumnyi and Mathematical model of Chermalyh</h2>

        <div align="justify">
            Today, the main problem of coveyor transport as an object of control is the unevenness of the freight flow.
            This problem leads to an excessive demolition of the conveyor belt and an inefficient use of drive power.
            To eliminate the unevenness of the cargo flow in the work of Razumnyi it is proposed to simulate the flow
            of coal on the main assembly conveyor and to analyze the main characteristics.
        </div>

        <div align="justify">
            Based on the results of the Chermalyh, the velocity and loading diagrams were obtained, which are shown below.
            They show the high quality of the transient processes in the dynamics and the accuracy of working out the set
            values ​​in the statics as to the angular velocity and to the electromagnetic moment of the engine.
            The drawings illustrate the realization of the idea of ​​supporting the constant loading of conveyor belts by
            adjusting the speed of the drive engine depending on the magnitude of the cargo flow.
            Energy indicators (power, high power factor and efficiency) show the effectiveness of the use of a
            frequency-controlled electric drive for a belt conveyor.

        <h2>Mathematical model of Prokuda</h2>

        <div align="justify">
            Changing the statistical characteristics of freight flows with the help of an adjustable drive affects
            the electricity consumption of mine conveyors. Prokuda in his work determined the effect of the
            adjustable speed of the tape and the characteristics of the flow of traffic to the consumption of the
            conveyor in connection with the introduction of CRP on the main transport of coal mines.
            The obtained result allows to assert about more full use of the energy efficiency reserve
            when adjusting the speed of the installed conveyors. With the growth of the number of conveyors
            in the line of reducing the cost of electricity reaches the limit, which is limited to the minimum speed
            of the tape.
            According to the table, it can be concluded that the summation of traffic flows coming from conveyors
            with an adjustable speed of the tape to the assembly line reduces the mathematical expectation of the
            time of absence of receipt to a greater extent than with the unregulated, and depends on the number
            of freight flows.
