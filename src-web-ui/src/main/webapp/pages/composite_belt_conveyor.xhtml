            Nowadays full conveyorisation of production becomes more and more popular. And it's not surprising,
            because conveyor systems provide reliable workfloat, quick transportation of high amount of materials,
            convenient and short transport routes.
            Many conveyor manufacturers provide different models and concepts of system arrangement.
            Here are represented Bastian Solutions' and Coneyor Units' ideas about conveyor systems structure.

        <h2>Belt conveyor systems for mines</h2>

        <div align="center">
            One of the most common use of Belt conveyor systems is transportation of raw materials from mines to plants.
            Surely coal mines occupy the biggest niche in the use of conveyor transport, but there are a lot of underground
            and overground pits, where conveyor systems are introduced.

            Liming Heavy Indusrty is one of the hugest conveyor manufaturers. Liming Co. LTD exists sinse 1987.
            Their conveyor systems function in more than 140 countries of the world.
            The most striking examples are conveyors in Chile at an iron ore mine and in the Philippines for the
            transportation of granite. The given systems consist of 6-7 elements and carry capacity up to 400 tons per
            hour. In addition to the central main conveyor, the systems also have boot, drain and return conveyors.

            Another one remarkable Belt Conveyor System functions in the underground gypsum mine in Novomoskovk, Russia.
            The depth of the mine is 130 meters. In the mine there are 5 branches, the total length of which is 500 km.
            The capacity of the conveyor system is more than 900 tons of material per hour. It should be noted that in
            addition to  belt conveyorы, the mine is equipped with reversible, suspended and vertical conveyors.

            One of its contrasts is location - this conveyor system is disposed overground.
            The total length of the conveyor system is about 3 km. It consists of 7 different kinds of conveyors, including
            crushing, unloading, tank and 2 recycling conveyors for processing. The total capacity of the system is 1000 tons per hour.

        <h2>Belt conveyor systems for storaged and warehouses</h2>

        <div align="center" >
            Another application of belt conveyor systems is in storages and warehouses.
            All largest delivery companies as UPS, FedEx, Amazon and so on use belt conveyor systems on their stocks.
            Remarkable that different repositories equipped with hundreds kilometers of conveyors.

        <div align="center">
            The biggest Amazon coveyor system is located in Dupon, USA.
            One of the most prominent and most well-known conveyor systems is the American Amazon conveyor network.
            It is located in a warehouse in DuPont, USA. It should be noted that the area of ​​this ordering center is more
            than 90 thousand square meters, and the conveyor system with a total length reaches 15 kilometers.
            All conveyors operating in the Amazon repository are different in length, bending parameters
            (different turns, etc.). In addition, packages can move from the bottom up and vice versa, rebuilding
            to shift if necessary. Thanks to the technologies implemented, each box is photographed and scanned in certain
            parts of the system.

            UPS storage has propably the biggest belt conveyor system amount all delivery companies.
            Total length of the system is 155 miles or 250 km. Each hour 416 000 of packages and mails are handled here.
            Generally this UPS conveyor system can process about 1.5 million packages per night.
            It should be noted that almost the whole process in the warehouses of Amazon and UPS is automated, which
            allows to significantly reduce the processing time of packages. At the point of handling UPS parcels, the person
            touches the load only twice, another work is left to the technique.
