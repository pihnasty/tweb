    <h2>Control system of Kien</h2>

    <div align="justify">
        The basic units of automated control of the system of belt conveyors are a set of equipment of the remote
        control: control panel, control panel adapter, communication line adapter; and a set of conveyor control
        equipment, which includes a conveyor control unit, linear modules, a shaker and siren module, an acoustic
        sensor and a power supply.
        One of the potentially effective methods of control is the use of a frequency converter.
        Frequency converter is a static converting device designed to control and change the speed of asynchronous
        electric motors and based on the principle of changing the frequency of power supply. Engine management can be
        based on the use of the frequency converter interface, as well as with other devices for monitoring and control
        at a distance.
        With the help of a frequency converter, it is possible to provide automation of the operation of the system of
        drives, namely start, braking, change in the speed of the electric motor. The advantages of the frequency
        converter are the automatic start and the possibility of changing the current. Changing the speed of the
        electric motor will avoid complex transients in electrical networks, ensuring the operation of the equipment
        in an economical mode.

    <h2>Control system of Mazurkiewicz</h2>

    <div align="justify">
        The principle of operation of the system is based on the correct use of a magnetic sensor located under
        a movable conveyor belt. The strength of the magnetic field increases when the magnet approaches the sensor;
        and when the magnet passes the sensor, the sensation of the strength of the magnetic field changes. The method
        of pulse recording, which works in this way, allows you to accurately measure the time between two measuring
        points. The resulting measurement data is sent to a computer equipped with appropriate software for obtaining
        and analyzing data and visualizing the results. An original monitoring system developed on this basis can signal
        in advance about the occurrence of conditions that are usually accompanied by the future.
        An important element of the computerized measuring system under discussion is its management system. The
        measurement control system is a system for controlling instantaneous changes in the length of conveyor belt
        connections, and consists of three components: a microprocessor, RAM, and a modem.
        The concept of the control system for conveyor belt connections, developed in this study, is sent to the
        real-time diagnostics of the object with simultaneous signaling and visualization of its condition.
        This system collects during its work a large number of different types of data that provide information
        about a diagnosed object.

    <h1>Control system of Stefaniak</h1>

    <div align="justify">
        The natural solution for spatial data is a geographic information system. In this paper, it is emphasized
        that the construction of the database system is not enough (it will not bring the expected profit), there is a
        need to provide a very advanced algorithm for data analysis for the diagnosis of validation of data, the
        classification and the search for the connection between the clusters and the state of the transmission, that is
        their diagnosis, reporting tools and other databases of maintenance procedures.
        In order to minimize maintenance costs, especially at the initiation stage, it was suggested to use an analysis
        of failures. After receiving information about the event's replacement, its cost, time, etc., you can choose the
        most critical critical element that brings most of the losses.
        From a practical point of view, given the reporting policy at the mine, the most important are simple reports
        that must be prepared monthly by the head of a particular department. They cover, for example, the analysis of
        malfunctions, its cost, time of an accident, etc. The Diag Manager system allows you to provide such messages
        through the Troubleshooting module.

    <h2>Control System of Gorniak-Zimroz</h2>

    <div align="justify">
        The constant increase in data volumes, the importance of knowledge and the enormous popularity of computer
        databases stimulate interest in automation of technology, intelligent and fast data processing, aimed
        at gaining knowledge about objects that are described by the data contained in the database. Geographic
        Information Systems (GIS) developed for the acquisition, verification, storage, integration, 3-D analysis
        and visualization of data in space associated with the Earth's surface, in which each element is described
        by the coordinates X, Y, or possibly Z, occupy a special place in the class of database systems.
        The graphic base consists of numerous thematic maps, orthophotomaps and numerical terrain models. 
        The specific objects of the graphical database are associated with a descriptive database, the content
        of which depends on the type and range of information stored in the databases.
        The concept put forth by the current authors is based on the use of some data from existing systems. 
        Thematic maps, such as diagrams of the technological system, are constantly updated with the help of 
        geodetic surveying of mines. All machines are inventoried (usually in Excel spreadsheets or MSAcces) in 
        simple databases.
