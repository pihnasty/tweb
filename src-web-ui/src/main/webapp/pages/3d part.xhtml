    <h2>The results of simulation</h2>

    <div align="justify">
        As a result of the analysis of the work of the district transport system, a new way of automatic control
        of the conveyor line with intermediate bunkers is developed, which consists in regulating the operation
        of the system elements depending on the current state of the system. Below is a description of the possible
        states of the transport system and the reactions of its elements in these situations.
        1 Normal operation of the plot. The combine works with nominal feed rate and performance, the conveyor also
        operates at nominal speed, the bunker operates in transit mode.
        2 Emergency mode (accident at the trunk conveyor and its stop). In this case, it is possible to increase
        the work cycle of the site at the time of filling the hopper. With the help of the coordinating device,
        the hopper is transferred to the accumulating mode, the feed speed of the combine is reduced and, accordingly,
        the productivity, the speed of the conveyor is also reduced. The work continues until the bunker fills
        in completely.
        3 Overflow mode. After filling the hopper, the coordinating device turns off the combine, turns off the loaded
        conveyor. The system is in this state until the failure of the main conveyor has been restored.
        4 Post-accident mode of operation of the site. The inclusion of a main conveyor allows the bunker to open
        for the delivery of cargo. Also, a local belt conveyor and harvester are included at the same time
        at a reduced speed. The plot works at these speeds until the empty hopper is empty. The district conveyor
        and the combine are then converted to a nominal speed.
