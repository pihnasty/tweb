        Increasing the productivity of coal mining raises the requirements for all technological
        processes of the mining enterprise. One of the most urgent tasks is to ensure
        the uninterrupted operation of the underground system, including the conveyor.
        Modern underground conveyor lines are characterized by considerable length and branching
        of transport highways, which over time change their parameters: length, topology, etc.
        For mine conveyor lines, the support at the entrance of the control object (the discrete
        nature of the load traffic and their variable intensity in the periods of continuous
        revenues), the internal divisions of the control object (emergency and emergency arresters
        of the line conveyors), perturbations at the output of the control object, connected with
        the limited carrying capacity of related transport links (receiving bunker, rail transport,
        cargo lift) or violation of their normal mode of operation.

    <h2>Model of process of transportation of mining mass by a district conveyor.</h2>

    <div align="justify">
        The mathematical model of the district belt conveyor must be represented in the form
        of a ratio linking the output cargo Quk entering the bunker, with the input cargo
        stream Qk, which is formed by the cleaning combine, and the velocity of the belt vuk.
        In developing the model, the results of research, presented in the works were used.
        In particular, it has been shown that the traffic flow rate, coming from the strip
        of the district conveyor and entering the storage hopper.

    <h2>Algorithm</h2>

    <div align="justify">
        The transport delay T, is the magnitude of the variable, which depends on
        the velocity vuk. Knowledge of this value is necessary for determining the output flow
        of Quk conveyor. The method of determining this value for the conditions of the variable
        speed conveyor consists in numerical integration and control of the distance passing
        through the cargo.
        A block diagram of an algorithm that implements the procedure for finding the value
        of the transport delay T and the velocity value vuk (t-T) according to the method.

    </div>

    <div align="justify">
        In block 2, the current value of the conveyor speed Vn is input. The resulting speed
        value is used to increase the current value of the path traveled by the cargo
        fragment (block 3). In addition, the value of the integration step increases
        the current value of the transport delay (block 4). The path passed by each of
        the fragments of the cargo on the tape can not exceed the length of the conveyor.
        This condition is controlled in block 5. While the condition is not fulfilled, cyclic
        calculations are made, which include reducing the distance traveled by deducting from
        it the intervals corresponding to the moment of arrival of the fragment of cargo loaded
        onto the tape (block 6). Simultaneously with the corresponding number of integration
        steps, the transport delay (block 7) decreases and the value of the index increases
        corresponding to the moment when the fragment of the cargo arrives on the tape (block 8).
