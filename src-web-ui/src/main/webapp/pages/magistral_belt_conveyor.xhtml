        At the moment, the task of automatic control of the performance of conveyors
        is to become actual for the stabilization of cargo flow and optimization of their operation modes.
        The main belt conveyor is designed for straightforward transportation of fractional materials.
        At the top of the conveyor belt, fractional materials are transported from one place of loading to another location.
